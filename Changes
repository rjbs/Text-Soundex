Revision history for Perl extension Text::Soundex.

3.00  Sun Jan 26 04:08:00 EST 2003 <mark@mielke.cc>

Updated documentation, simplified the Perl interface, and updated
the XS code to be faster, and to properly work with UTF-8 strings.
UNICODE characters outside the ASCII range (0x00 - 0x7F) are
considered to be non-alphabetic for the purposes of the soundex
algorithms.

2.10  Sun Feb 15 15:29:38 EST 1998 <mark@mielke.cc>

I've put in a version of my XS code and fully integrated it with the
existing 100% perl mechanism. The change should be virtually transparent
to the user. XS code is approx 7.5 times faster.
