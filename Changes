Revision history for Perl extension Text::Soundex.

2.10  Sun Feb 15 15:29:38 EST 1998 <markm@nortel.ca>

I've put in a version of my XS code and fully integrated it with the
existing 100% perl mechanism. The change should be virtually transparent
to the user. XS code is approx 7.5 times faster.

Incorporated Mark Mielke's rewritten version of the main soundex routine
