Text::Soundex Version 2.00

This is a perl 5 module implementing the Soundex algorithm described by 
Knuth.  Mark Mielke suggested a complete rewrite of the code for version
2.00, Mike Stok's old code has been retired :-)

Once the archive has been unpacked then the following steps are needed
to build, test and install the module (to be done in the directory which
contains the Makefile.PL)

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

If the make test succeeds then the next step may need to be run as root
(on a Unix-like system) or with special privileges on other systems.

  make install

If any of the tests report 'not ok' and you're running perl 5.004 or later
then please contact Mike Stok <mike@stok.co.uk>
