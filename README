This is the Text::Soundex module with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with MPW and Codewarrior.  Passed all tests.  
I have no 68K machine so I can't test the CFM68K version.  Let me 
know of any problems.

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell,
or the installme droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install CNANDOR/Text-Soundex-2.13-bin-2-Mac.tgz

#===================================

Text::Soundex Version 2.12

This is a perl 5 module implementing the Soundex algorithm described by 
Knuth.  Mark Mielke suggested a complete rewrite of the code for version
2.00, Mike Stok's old code has been retired :-) Recently, Mark threw in
his XS version that works approx. 7.5 times faster than the 100% perl
version.

Once the archive has been unpacked then the following steps are needed
to build, test and install the module (to be done in the directory which
contains the Makefile.PL)

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

If the make test succeeds then the next step may need to be run as root
(on a Unix-like system) or with special privileges on other systems.

  make install

If you do not want to use the XS code (for whatever reason) do the following
instead of the above:

  perl Makefile.PL --no-xs
  make
  make test
  make install

If any of the tests report 'not ok' and you're running perl 5.004 or later
then please contact Mark Mielke <markm@nortel.ca>
